# project-happening

Proposal Documents can be found on the [_About_](https://github.com/CSCI2254/project-happening/wiki/About) page in the wiki.

4/11
- Looks good.  I really like the wiki.

RUBRIC - For Data Documentation
CRITERIA:
Create SQL Complete for all tables. Table names and field names well
chosen, clearly presented.
COMMENTS:
You only have two tables, and no relationship between them. In the wiki,
your mockups indicate a lot more data than that, for example selecting a 
college.  There should be a list of colleges somewhere.  It also seems
that there should be a relationship between users and events.  With
just the two tables, how do you know who created an event?  You also imply
organizations can create events.  Should organizations have a relationship
with users?  For example, should an organization be able to notify
a user that an event has been inserted?
SCORE: 4 / 5 pts 
**********************
CRITERIA:
Populate SQL Complete - data is representative. All associations have
specific records demonstrating their relationships.
COMMENTS:
createuserinsertion.sql should have real data.
Your mockup data is fine, but add a smaller set with more meaningful 
info.  You will need to add more as you improve the relationships in
your data.
SCORE: 5 / 5 pts 
**********************
CRITERIA:
All use cases documented with actor, pre/post conditions, queried and UI
mockup - there must be a sufficient number of use cases to receive full
credit. Five is the absolute minumum. Is the purpose and function of the
use case clear?
COMMENTS:
Completely missing.  Your pre and post are for actors only, not for the
actual use cases.
SCORE: 0 / 30 pts 
**********************
CRITERIA:
Is purpose and function of the project clear? Note this is only 5
points, but its really crucial.
COMMENTS:
Yes, but the data model does not support it.
SCORE: 5 / 5 pts 
**********************
CRITERIA:
Data documentation includes a ER diagram.
COMMENTS:
Yes, but it needs substantial work
SCORE: 5 / 5 pts

Total Points: 20 out of 50
